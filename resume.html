                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    My background is in logistics and operations. I have experience in leading a team in a large-scale operation
                    to deliver safe, efficient, and on-time logistics support to meet customer's needs profitably.
                    I have recently enrolled in Code:You to learn data analytics, web development, and software development and am looking to transition into a
                    more long-term career that will allow my natural skills to thrive as well as continued education and growth.
